UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

CRIMINAL CASE NO. 20-20-DLB-CJS
CIVIL ACTION NO. 24-84-DLB-CJS
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
V.
ORDER ADOPTING REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
LAMON TOLBERT
** ** ** ** ** ** ** **
PLAINTIFF
DEFENDANT
This matter is before the Court upon the Report and Recommendation ("R&R") of
United States Magistrate Judge Candace J. Smith (Doc. #48), wherein she recommends
that Defendant's Motion to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct a Sentence under 28 U.S.C.
ยง 2255 (Doc. # 45) be denied. No objections having been filed, and the time to do so
having now expired, the R&R is ripe for the Court's consideration.
The Court having reviewed the R&R, concluding that it is sound in all respects, and being otherwise
sufficiently advised,
IT IS ORDERED as follows:
(1) The Magistrate Judge's R&R (Doc. # 48) is hereby ADOPTED as the
findings of fact and conclusions of law of the Court;
(2) The Defendant's Motion to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct a Sentence under
28 U.S.C. ยง 2255 (Doc. #45) is hereby DENIED;
(3) This matter is DISMISSED with prejudice and STRICKEN from the Court's
active docket; and
Case: 0:20-cr-00020-DLB-CJS Doc #: 49 Filed: 01/23/25 Page: 2 of 2 - Page ID#: <pageID>
(4) For the reasons set forth herein and in Judge Smith's Report and
Recommendation (Doc. #48), the Court determines that there is no arguable merit for an
appeal in this matter and, therefore, NO CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY SHALL
ISSUE.
This 23rd day of January, 2025.
