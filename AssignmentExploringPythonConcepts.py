# Task 1 - Variables: Your First Python Intro
# Letâ€™s start simple! Imagine youâ€™re describing yourself (or anyone else you like) using Python variables.
#
# Create a name variable that stores a string (like your name or a fictional characterâ€™s name).
# Create an age variable that stores an integer value.
# Create a height variable that stores a floating-point number.
# For example, something like this:
#
# name = "Alex"
# age = 25
# height = 5.9
# Now print these variables in a friendly message:
#
# Example Output: "Hey there, my name is Alex! Iâ€™m 25 years old and 5.9 feet tall."
# Feel free to get creative with the message! ðŸš€
#
# Task 2 - Operators: Playing with Numbers
# We all love some math, donâ€™t we? Okay, maybe not everyone, but trust me, this will be easy and fun!
#
# Pick two numbers, letâ€™s say num1 and num2 (you choose the values!).
# Perform the following operations on these numbers:
# Addition
# Subtraction
# Multiplication
# Division
# Write your Python code to calculate and display the results with a nice message for each.
# For example:
#
# num1 = 10
# num2 = 3
# print("The sum of 10 and 3 is", num1 + num2)
# Be sure to explain what youâ€™re doing in comments! Bonus points if you throw in some humor. ðŸ˜„
#
# Task 3 - Conditional Statements: The Number Checker
# Now for the real challenge: letâ€™s make your code think!
#
# Write a program that takes a number from the user and tells them whether itâ€™s positive, negative, or zero.
# Hereâ€™s how it should work:
#
# Ask the user to enter a number (use the input() function).
# Use if, elif, and else statements to check:
# If the number is greater than 0, print: "This number is positive. Awesome!"
# If the number is less than 0, print: "This number is negative. Better luck next time!"
# If the number is exactly 0, print: "Zero it is. A perfect balance!"
# Make sure to test your code with a few different numbers. Youâ€™ll be surprised how fun it
# is to see your program come to life! ðŸ’»âœ¨
